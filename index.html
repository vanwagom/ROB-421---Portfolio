                    <p>This was the finals for the class pupper race. We had narrowly won the primaries and then went on to win it all! We were able to get our mini pupper to move farily fast but consistenly had a problem with it moving left or right during it's inital steps. But once we got moving in the right direction our mini pupper moved fast!

                    <p>Using the Misty Blockly coding interface, I created a program that allows a user to play 
                        rock, paper, scissors against Misty. Using the bump sensors, you choose your decision 
                        and Misty will randomly choose a decision. Based on if you win or lose, Misty will react.

                        First, Misty will ask if you are ready to play in which you will answer verbally yes or no. 
                        When the game starts, Misty will say "red light" and turn the LED red. If you move durring 
                        the red light phase, if you move you lose. Misty will then say "green light" and turn the LED 
                        green. During this phase, you can move and you will be safe. These phases last for a random 
                        amount of time. Once you are close enough, you can tap a bumper to win the game.

                    <p>For my third artifact, I worked with the mini pupper robot. I was tasked with the 
                        creation and testing of the physical catapult. I first created multiple ideas on how 
                        I could tackle this step. Taking the positives of each idea, I was able to choose a
                        final design to create. Using aluminum, plastic boards, and steel bolts and springs,
                        I created our catapult that could attach on the pupper robot. It launches automatically 
                        with a servo, and the marble travels about four feet forward.

                        This game is similar to the very-copywrited Jeopardy, but is distinctly different... 
                        Answer each question correctly--you only get three tries per question. Don't forget to say 
                        "What is"! Using SpeechRecognition in Python and the Whisper API, processing is done outside 
                        of Misty to avoid issues experienced with the onboard NLP tooling of Misty, enabling more 
                        accurate choice and response interactions.

                    <h2>Misty - Comedy routine</h2>
                    <p>For my first artifact, I programmed misty to perform a comedy routine where she waits for the audiences response afterwards and responds accordingly. 
                    I origonally invisioned Misty walking around and gesturing at the audience. However for the sake of time I had her stand still and simply move her arms back and forth.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                    This project was coded using the blockly code language which turned out to be very frustrating as it didn't allow for conventional coding structure, making the process repetative and tedious. Any changes to a simple gesture needed to be reconfigured for each point in the set, this lead to jagged motion and discontinous voice lines. However I was able to get a working demo completed and misty gave a great show!

                    <h2>Misty - Follow Left or Right</h2>
                    <p>My second artifact was the most difficult for me. I wanted to have Misty use her cameras to detect a person and follow them around the room. I succeeded in being able to get a RTSP stream from the webcam and was able to run object detection through openCV and YOLO. However the stream was far to slow, having about a 8 second delay, causing the directions sent to misty unreliable and often overlapping with eachother. I spent a lot of time trying to optimize the stream in order to improve the latency using ffmpeg and much lower resolutions, but I was unable to solve the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Eventually I pivoted to using Misty's voice recognition system to tell her where to go. This also has several problems, so I further pivoted to using a voice recognizing fuction that could tell if the user said yes or no. I used this fuction to have misty move left when the user says no, and right on yes. The outcome of this project was far simpler than I origonally desired, and I still feel like I could get the object detection system working with a better RTSP stream from Misty's webcam.

                    <h2>Mini Pupper - Sense Person and Acknowledge</h2>
                    <p>My third artifact consisted of using a web cam and a DAC + speaker connected to a mini pupper to detect a person infront of the pupper and respond with a voice line. This project built on the work I had done for artifact 2 with the Misty, as I was able to use much of the object detection code I had written for it. The code analyzes the camera stream with the YOLO object detection library, and draws a box around any detected objects. I was able to determine the center of this box for any person in the cameras feild of view and used that to determine if someone was standing infront of the pupper. The program then actiavates the speaker with the "hello there" voice line.

                    <p>Hello.
                       My name is Declan Murray. I am a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student at Oregon State University. I am passionate about design as my hobbies include 3D modeling and printing, coding, and biking. This portfolio demonstrates my work in Robotics 421 on the Misty II robot and Minipupper.

            <h2>Misty - Touch Command</h2>
            <p>For this artifact, I attempted to use Misty's touch sensors to drive it around objects using the built in blockly coding tools.
                Using these controls, Misty was able to drive around an obstacle placed in front of her, turn around and go back to where she started, or do a full loop around the obstacle.
                Misty was able to perform all these movements and end up in predetermined locations repeatedly without issue.

            <h2>Misty - Yep, that's a...</h2>
            <p>Built into Misty is an object detection function and a built in system that lets her identfy objects from premade categories. Using this function, I had Misty ask for several specific objects. These objects were a book, a person, and a backpack. 
                
                While the detection software is rather crude, Misty was able to identify all the objects I wanted it to and Misty did not get stuck on repeat identifying the same thing multiple times. Misty was very fast in acquring and identifying objects with a high degree of accuracy, only faltering when more than one of the desired objects was in her field of view.

            <h2>Minipupper - Strafe that way</h2>
            <p>For this artifact, I wanted to be able to get the pupper to move side to side using hardware interface commands. In theory this method would give me more precision and control in how the robot makes any individual move. 
                However in practice, the pupper was far less stable and movement in any given direction was was more luck based. While this movement system is less robust, it is more precise with how each servo in the leg moves, allowing for selected motions to be made rather than a general movement system in the basic code. Because of this, our team has more control in making the robot move.
